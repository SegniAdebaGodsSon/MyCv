            <h1>Relative size(%,em,rem) and responsive elements.</h1>
            <article>
                <p>It matters to use relative sizes like percentage(%), em and rem to create
                    responsive elements of a website. It gives it a consistent, non-chaotic, simple
                    type of look to the end user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These relative lengths are different from the normal absolute lengths because
                    Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative 
                    length units scales better between different rendering mediums.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But absolute lengths units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
                    Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, 
                    because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used 
                    if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Why are they so important to responsive and modern web pages?
                    the reasons are as mentioned above, the relative lengths consider 
                    all platforms for the website to be veiwed upon any various types of 
                    devices with various sizes and resolutions.

                    Browser capabilities a while ago were tedious, they used to increase the
                    font sizes of every and each charachters individually but nowadays, zooming
                    just mostly adjusting the screen to make it more readable but also not lose its looks.
